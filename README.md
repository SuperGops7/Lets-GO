# Lets-GO

1.**Day - 1**

A basic introduction to the GO environment and its corresponding I/O operations. The echo program was created.

2.**Day - 2**

Most of the Data types, basic and composite, were covered. A program that implemented type conversion was done.

Fun fact: There's no type-casting in GOlang. :O

3.**Day - 3**

Conditionals and Loops were covered. The cliched calculator program was implemented to make the conditional concepts thorough.

Fun fact: GO only has the for loop, the other loops (and even the if clause!) can be implemented using this.
