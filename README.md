# Lets-GO

1.**Day - 1**

A basic introduction to the GO environment and its corresponding I/O operations. The echo program was created.

2.**Day - 2**

Most of the Data types, basic and composite, were covered. A program that implemented type conversion was done.
Fun fact: There's no type-casting in GOlang. :O
